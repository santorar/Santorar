How are you doing? Thank you for being here today, if I am not coding or doing school work. I am either watching kdrama, listening to music(kpop, pop, rock, jpop, black metal, etc...) or ricing.
Here are few things about me.
- I'm a Linux and Open Source Enthusiast
- Tiling Window Manager Fanboy
- Have done some Programming Competitions
- A systems engineering student
